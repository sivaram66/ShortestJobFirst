Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm
This is a Java program that demonstrates the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm using a binary search tree (BST) to maintain the order of processes based on their execution time.

Program Overview
The program defines a Process class to represent a process with attributes like process ID, process name, and execution time.

A Node class is defined to create nodes of a binary search tree where each node contains a Process object and links to left and right child nodes.

The insert method is used to insert processes into the binary search tree based on their execution time. Shorter execution times are placed to the left, and longer execution times to the right.

The Inorder method is used to perform an inorder traversal of the binary search tree, which prints the processes in the order they will be scheduled.

In the main method, several sample processes are created and scheduled using the SJF algorithm. The order of execution is displayed as output.

How to Use
Compile the Java program using your preferred Java compiler, for example, in your command line or using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code.

Run the compiled Java program. This will execute the SJF scheduling algorithm and display the order in which the processes are scheduled.

Sample Output
Here's an example of the output you can expect:

yaml
Copy code
Processes scheduled using SJF:
Process ID: 4, Name: Process D, Execution Time: 1
Process ID: 2, Name: Process B, Execution Time: 2
Process ID: 1, Name: Process A, Execution Time: 5
Process ID: 3, Name: Process C, Execution Time: 8
Note
This program is a simple demonstration of the SJF scheduling algorithm using a binary search tree. In a real operating system, you would typically deal with a larger number of processes and additional complexities.

Make sure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this code as needed for your educational or project purposes.
